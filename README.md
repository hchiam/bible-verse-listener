Try it here:
- https://bibleverse.surge.sh (faster to load with basic functionality, but user must enter apiKey _just once_ to get verse words showing (stores API key in a cookie))
- https://bibleverse.glitch.me (slower to load, but has hidden API key so you don't have to enter one to automatically display the verse words)

The glitch.me source code is here: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/bibleverse
